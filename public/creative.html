<h1>Creative Exercise</h1>

<h2>Brief</h2>

<p>We are using tables in some places on our marketing site <code>https://www.netlify.com/pricing</code> or <code>https://www.netlify.com/features/adn</code> but these are not spectacular when it comes to responsive layout. How can we design these tables to adapt better on smaller viewports, and making them more usable for mobile devices?</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>As this is more of a divergent thinking task, I am not going to document my process, but rather the final solutions. To do that, here&#39;s the desktop table we are starting with:</p>

<figure><img src="images/creative/Desktop%20Table.png"/></figure>

<ol>
	<li>The first solution that came to mind was to stack the columns into collections we can later reuse. The problem with this solution, though, is that it&#39;s hard to compare between the plans or the rows in general and therefore, it&#39;s not really a viable solution, as the non-responsive table does a better job at that.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one of the images on the left is a bit too heavy, as the colors make it a bit unbalanced. As a reaction to the colorfulness of the image on the left side, we have the image on the middle, which is the opposite, though that one could be too bland. The best compromise happens when mixing both worlds. As we can see, this table does a good job at being responsive, but it is hard to understand the full picture of one specific plan versus the other.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>The second solution is much simpler, which is to stack the rows into different tables in the vertical axis. And, although that&#39;s a better way to display the information, and allows for users to scroll, it may be hard, not only to compare, but to scan the information, specially if that table is long enough.</li>
</ol>

<p>While the image on the left has multiple cards to separate the different table sections, the one on the right forms a vertical scroll that may or may not differentiate well enough the change of plan.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>The final and used solution is to have a segmented control on top of the table and, though that doesn&#39;t necessarily allow to compare the plans in the easiest of ways, it allows to focus on one of the teams, and therefore, see the full condensed information of a table at a glance, while quickly having the ability to change with the sticky header at the top. Needs to be said that swiping/dragging on the table, would change the segmented control position as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first image on the left has the easiest visual treatment that comes to mind with the solution above. However, and because other languages could have longer names, and scrolling horizontally is what we want to get rid of, we have an additional row of content on the image on the right</p>
